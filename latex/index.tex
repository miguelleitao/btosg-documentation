A programming framework to build visual physical simulations.

btosg is aimed to ease building simple visual physical simulation applications integrating Bullet and Open\+Scene\+Graph. btosg stands on top of these two A\+P\+Is but does not try to hide them. Instead, in order to build a complete application, the programmer is able and usually needs to access directly the data structures from both Bullet and Open\+Scene\+Graph. So, the use of btosg does not avoid the requirement to know and understand their A\+P\+Is.

The use of btosg can help the programming task because it allows to create and position both the physical and graphics definitions of small objects in one step. It also keeps track of syncronizing the graphics definitions from the state of each physical object.
